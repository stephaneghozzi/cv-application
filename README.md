# Template for job application with CV

A LaTeX template for job applications:
- table of contents
- CV
- cover letter
- research summary
- referees

The template itself is [cv-application.tex](cv-application.tex) with the PDF output [cv-application.pdf](cv-application.pdf).

To generate the CV only, just remove the rest and the table of contents, and adapt the footer. See for example [cv-ghozzi.tex](cv-ghozzi.tex) and [cv-ghozzi.pdf](cv-ghozzi.pdf).

Overall the layout should also be adapted to the content to avoid as much as possible bad page breaks.

 - bibliography included
 - automatic timestamp in the footer

 - dates in the chosen format
 - page numbering
